# Tailoring P02 protect helper input and session identity

## Background

Planned only. Implement P02 from docs/plans/2026-09-30-tailoring-v10-execution-packets.md, following the frozen contract in docs/plans/2026-09-30-tailoring-v10-implementation.md. Execution will use gpt-6-luna with max reasoning later; no implementation or agents started during planning.

## Investigation

Derived from audit T01–T12 and the subsequent ideal-CV, inference, and
independent-PDF-review discussion. See the
[implementation plan](../../docs/plans/2026-09-30-tailoring-v10-implementation.md)
and [execution packets](../../docs/plans/2026-09-30-tailoring-v10-execution-packets.md).

## Decision

Keep the blind ideal-CV stage, enable reasonable inference, retain advisory
owner judgment, and bind review to the actual canonical PDF. Execution uses
gpt-6-luna with max reasoning later, under coordinator-managed file ownership.

## Implementation

Pending packet P02. Parent feature: FEAT-01M3T3Z9FBY8M2EAXQVC5AZMZP.
The linked packet defines owned files, dependencies, focused verification,
and acceptance conditions. Do not broaden scope or change frozen contracts
without coordinator review.

## Verification

Planning only. Runtime checks and semantic PDF inspection are specified in
the plan and have not been executed for this implementation work.

## Follow-up
Root coordinates tracker transitions and integrates work in dependency order.
Do not mark this entry DONE until its acceptance evidence exists.
